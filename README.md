This is a semester project participating in the "Introduction to Design Media" class for the MSc in Design and Digital Media (2009-2010) at the University of Edinburgh.

The brief of this project asked for the design of two devices:
- a screen apparatus
- a projector device
- These devices where to be designed by implementing the designs of old srap and unused items or by customizing old devices. All designs should transmit a general notion from the Victorian times.
- These designs should then be constructed in 3D using Blender.
- The second part was to create a 30 second 3D animation using these two devices.
